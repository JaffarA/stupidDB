>This project is designed for recreational purposes, and I would advise against using it for critical database requirements unless it's intended for similar small-scale and experimental projects.

### stupidDB

The dumbest PoC db I use for toy development. Not really actually a database, more of a python wrapper for a json file.

### Command Reference
```bash
just format  # runs black + isort
just lint  # runs mypy + ruff
just test  # runs tests
```
