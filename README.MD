>This project is designed for recreational purposes, and I would advise against using it for critical database requirements unless it's intended for similar small-scale and experimental projects.

### stupidDB

The dumbest PoC db I use for toy development. Not really actually a database, more of a python wrapper for a json file.

### Command Reference
```bash
just format  # runs black + isort
just lint  # runs mypy + ruff
just test  # runs tests
just coverage  # prints coverage report (run after tests)
```

### Example Usage
```python
from stupiddb import StupidDB, StupidLock

db_path = "example_db.json"
lock_path = "example_lock.json"


def register_user(user: dict[str, str]) -> bool:
    # initialize db
    stupid_db = StupidDB(db_path)

    # initialize lock
    lock = StupidLock(lock_path)

    try:
        # acquire lock
        lock.acquire_lock()

        # insert user into db
        stupid_db.insert(user)

        # release lock
        lock.release_lock()
    except Exception as e:
        # handle exception
        # ...something went wrong, the user was not registered
        return False

    return True

alice = {"name": "alice", "age": "21"}
alice_is_registered = register_user(alice)
print(alice_is_registered)  # True
```
